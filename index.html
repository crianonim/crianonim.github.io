                            a delicious stream of cultures and languages that piqued my <em>curiosity</em> even more.</p><p>

                                Technology lets me transcend my biology. I can <em>communicate</em> with others without
                                space limitations.

                                I am able to interact with my internal <em>creativity</em>, be equal to ancient gods with my
                                powers to make things as I see fit with code.

                                I <em>relax</em> playing video games (there are games that let me farm, cook, tell a story
                                using a foreign language, ticking all my hobbies).
                                Technology is fun!

            <h1>So why am I applying for admission to Your bootcamp?</p>
            <h2>I Love to code</h2>
            <p>I always have. I wrote my first line in 1991 on my new Commodore 64 in BASIC and was instantly hooked.
                Since then I <em>played</em> with other languages, always as a hobby. I learned to use Linux and still
                use
                it to keep me out of my comfort zone. I made hundreds tiny code-toys, for the joy of coding. Never
                anything
                serious or usable.
            </p>
            <h2>Change of career</h2>
            <p>I have worked my whole working life in service industry, made millions of sandwiches and megalitres of
                lattes.
                I've loved the exprience, customer interaction and teamwork required. While chatting with a customer in
                my last
                employment (tech company) I learned about You (they hire you graduates) and that I should apply. I would
                like to turn
                my lifelong passion into a career with Your help.
            </p>
            <h2>Collaborative working</h2>
            <p>I appreciate the importance of teamwork and I would like to exprience how does it apply to coding. I can
                follow any number
                of tutorials and learn APIs by heart but all these won't give me to opportunity to exprience pair
                programming and participating
                in team projects like You would.
            </p>
            <h2>Your educational model</h2>
            <p>The best things in life are free. It is not about being cheap, but a goal that is changing lives for
                better and not money, while
                being sustainable. I belive in giving back. I would love to be a part of You.

            <h2>freeCodeCamp.org</h2>
            <p>I am learning, practising at freeCodeCamp. I've long ago past the mininum requirements, but it's treasure
                trove
                of training so I just carry on. Thank you very much for pointing me towards this invaluable resource.
                Even if I
                don't get a place I am aleady a winner!

            <h2>Codewars</h2>
            <p>Not only it's incredibly addictive, but I get satisfaction from both solving katas but also from helping
                others.
                The gamer in me can't stop playing, leveling up. I learned to look at the problem from very different
                perspective, as a rule
                I try to understand top solutions and compare to mine. I learned a lot and keep learning.

            <h2>The Website</h2>
            <p>
                This website enabled me to use what I learned at the above resources, it's my first shot at web design.
                I now know how to use git, how to host on github pages, how to keep my repository on github.com.

            <h2>Thank you!</h2>
            <p>
                Thank You very much for the preparation journey that happened because of You. This application process
                already made me
                more confident, I learned a ton and I really hope You will give me an opportunity to get to the next
                stage and ultimately get a place at your bootcamp
