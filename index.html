                        <p>Hello lovely people from Founders and Coders. I'm 38 years old (no!) Pole, living in South
                            London. I've been working all my life
                            in service industry making sandwiches or coffee during the day and then playing with programming
                            after. I think my personal interests below will show you my characteristics that lead me to your bootcamp.</p>

                                    Since childhood I've <em>loved learning</em> languages. In London I just kept going thanks to
                                    a delicious stream of cultures and languages that piqued my <em>curiosity</em> even more.
                                    I'm fluent in Portugues do Brasil, can have una buena conversación en español,
                                    order food in un ristorante italiano. I like to think that my JavaScript is becoming more fluent as well...

                                    Nothing bring me more joy then watching something <em>grow!</em> Especially if it's something
                                    i planted, sowed, <em>started from scratch</em>. Then with careful cultivation it <em>develops</em>
                                    through different stages into a new, living thing.

                                  I like learning new recipes (algorithms?) form others and improve my craft.
                                   I like as well to <em>experiment</em> and come up with new.
                                   The best is that you <em>share</em> the fruit of your labour and form a little <em>community</em>
                                   even if ephemeral and limited in space to your dining table. Oh, and I like to eat!

                                    Magna carta, the Tudor court, colonialism? I love to learn about it all. Studying history let's us 
                                    <em>learn from exprience of others</em> in the past. People had so many <em>great ideas we can copy</em>,
                                     and have done
                                    horrible <em>mistakes we should avoid</em>. It's often exciting narrative as well.

                                    Technology lets me transcend my biology. I can <em>communicate</em> with others without space limitations.
                                    I am able to interact with my internal <em>creativity</em>, be equal to ancient gods with my powers to make things as I see fit with code.
                                    I <em>relax</em> playing video games (there are games that let me farm, cook, tell a story using a forein language, tick all my hobbies).
                                    Technology is fun!
